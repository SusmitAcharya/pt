                    Hello, my name is Susmit Acharya!
                    <br>
                    I am from India
                    <br>
                    I am a Student of 9th Grade, currently studying in Auxilium Convent School, Barasat, Kolkata - 700124
                    <br>
                    I have some big plans for my future with my first and foremost aim of being a professional Web Designer. 
                    Web Designing with the simple tools of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the front-end and Node.js nad MongoDB in the back-end has always amazed me.
                    The simplicity in the tools and yet the many powerful things we can make with the help of them.
                    <br><br>
                    I am also highly attracted towards music and musical instruments
                    <br>
                    I had always had a craze for music and in April of 2022, I started learning one of my favourite instruments, the Guitar!
                    <br>
                    In just a few weeks, I played my first song on it and have been learning more and more ever since!

                    I started learning to code back in 6th Grade when my school book introduced me to HTML. Although it was based on the CISCE curricullum and did not have too many things in it,
                    it introduced me to a wide world of coding and programming and the endless possibillities in it.
                    <br>
                    I fell in love with it and looked up online courses on Web Designing in the early part of 8th Grade. In doing so, I came across Angela Yu's Course on Web Designing which is one of the highest-rated courses on Udemy.
                    I purchased the course and started learning. From it, I learned the concepts of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                    <br>
                    In mid 8th Grade, my school introduced me to Java and some of it's basic concepts. It is indeed beautiful that in the CISCE curricullum, the entire of 9th Grade and 10th Grade covers up all concepts of Core Java.
                    Whoever would be interested can opt for computers 11th Grade and learn further, beyond core Java. I definetly have plans on doing that. Furthermore, I enrolled myself in a lerning institute, Aptech Learning to help me learn even more programing concepts.
                    Computers absolutely fasinate me and I love learning more and more about them. Due to this love for computers, I have also done some cool projects out of my own interest. I have uploaded the projects to github and linked them in 
                    <a href="projects.html">Projects</a>. If you wish to check them out, go to the reffered page and slewct the project you wish to open and see!

                    In my musical journey, I had taken some siniging classes when I was small which helped shape my voice. My first song on the guitar was 'Happy Birthday'. My sister's birthday was coming up and thus i wanted to do something special for her 
                    and thus I chose it to be my first song to learn so that I can play it on her birthday!
                    <br>
                    My second song on the Guitar was 'Perfect' by Ed Sheeran. It was a relatively longer song and took some time to learn
                    <br>
                    I am attracted to Western pop and old Bollywood songs. Thus for my next song, I chose an old yet very famous Bollywood song sung by one of India's most well-known singers
                    Lata Mangeshwar, "Ek Pyaar Ka Nagma Hai". 
                    <br>
                    It was yet longer than my previous songs and took relatively equivalent time to learn.
                    <br>
                    After that, I went forward on learning the very well-known song of the Titanic movie, "My Heart Will Go On". 
                    <br>
                    Ever since, I have been learning even more and have become quite good at playing the instrument. After learning the Guitar to a standard level,
                    I have plans on moving to another of my favourite instruments, the Synthesizer!
                    <br>
                    When I was small, I had also learnt the Indian Instruments, Harmonium and Tabla but as I was too small back then and left practice, I don't remember much of it anymore but would love to learn it again if I had a chance to.

                    Another of my passions is to tour. I love vacations and trips, they make me so happy. I love seeing the world and all that it has to offer to us.
                    Natural places like forests, waterfalls, lakes, etc. are my favourite. I am more of a mountain person than a beach person. The cool weather of the mountains are my favourite
                    and the amazing view from the peak just makes me enthralled!
                    Reaching the Clouds is the feel I get from the Mountains!
                    <br>
                    Sadly these tours were affected by COVID-19 but I still go on small trips every now and then :D
                    <br><br>
                    I had also learned to draw when I was small. I have drawn some potraits of my friends for thier birthdays as a present and casually paint sometimes.
                    Sketching with pen and painting witha toothbrush and string are by far the most innovative stykes of painting taught to me by my teacher. I was left absolutely amazed by them
                    and have made some pretty good paintaings out of them.
                    <br><br>
                    I am also a trained fighter. I have learned the basics of Karate and can face some fight-like situtaions easily and dfend myself.
                    I have learned the Shotokan Karate technique and have reached till the green belt which is the last of the beginner belts. Beyond that I have learned some more techniques out of my own will and have trained myself
                    to face harsh real-life situations easily.
